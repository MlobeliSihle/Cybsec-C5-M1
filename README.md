# Understanding Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

In cybersecurity, addressing incidents effectively requires **clear communication**, **precise definitions**, and **team coordination**. This guide covers three foundational concepts in security: **risks**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities** — and how they relate to one another in planning and response.

---

## Key Definitions

| Term          | Definition                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Risk**      | Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. |
| **Threat**    | Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.               |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.                          |

> These terms are often used interchangeably in everyday language but have **very specific meanings in cybersecurity**.

---

## What Is a Security Risk?

Risk is defined differently across organizations, but in security, it generally refers to:

> **Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

### Real-world analogy:
- **Risk**: Being late to work
- **Threat**: A nail in the road
- **Vulnerability**: Your tires being susceptible to puncture

### Why Calculate Risk?
- Prevent costly and disruptive events  
- Identify system/process improvements  
- Determine which risks are tolerable  
- Prioritize attention to critical assets  

As a security analyst, you’ll often **focus on likelihood**, working to reduce risks by minimizing vulnerabilities or avoiding threats.

---

## Risk Factors

There are two main contributors to risk:

### Threats
Events or conditions that can negatively impact assets.

### Vulnerabilities
Weaknesses in systems or behaviors that can be exploited by threats.

---

## Categories of Threats

| Type            | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intentional** | A hacker exploits a misconfigured application.                         |
| **Unintentional** | An employee accidentally lets an unauthorized person into a secure area. |

---

## Categories of Vulnerabilities

| Type            | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technical**   | A misconfigured application or outdated system.                         |
| **Human**       | A lost access badge or falling for phishing emails.                     |

Both technical and human weaknesses contribute to overall organizational risk.

# Common Classification Requirements in Asset Management

Effective cybersecurity starts with **asset management** — identifying, tracking, and classifying what needs protection. You can only protect what you know you have.

---

## Why Asset Management Matters

Organizations rely on many types of assets to function and stay secure. To protect them, they must understand:

- **What** they have  
- **Where** it is  
- **Who** owns it  
- **How important** it is  

### Types of Assets

| Asset Type         | Examples                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Digital**        | Customer data, financial records              |
| **Information Systems** | Networks, databases, software          |
| **Physical**       | Facilities, equipment, supplies               |
| **Intangible**     | Brand reputation, intellectual property       |

>  **Asset classification** helps organizations label and prioritize assets based on **sensitivity** and **importance**.

---

## Common Asset Classification Levels

Asset classification helps with:

- Prioritizing security resources  
- Reducing IT costs  
- Meeting legal and compliance requirements  

### Typical Classification Scheme:

| Level        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Restricted**   | Highest sensitivity; access limited to essential personnel only          |
| **Confidential** | Exposure could significantly harm the organization                       |
| **Internal-Only**| Intended for internal use by employees and trusted partners              |
| **Public**       | Lowest sensitivity; safe to disclose externally                          |

>  Note: Some organizations (e.g., governments) may use **different labels** (e.g., using “Confidential” for the highest level).

---

## Challenges in Asset Classification

### Ownership Confusion
Determining the **owner** of an asset isn’t always straightforward.  
**Example:**  
A company issues a laptop to an employee →  
- Is the company the owner?
- What if the employee stores personal data (photos, documents)?

### Multiple Classifications
Some information includes a mix of sensitivity levels.  
**Example:**  
A letter to you may include:
- **Public info**: Your name  
- **Confidential info**: Your address  

This mix makes it hard to assign a single classification level.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Every organization** has different classification requirements.
- Asset classification is key to a strong **risk management strategy**.
- **Information assets** are among the most complex and important to classify.
- As a cybersecurity professional, your role includes:
  - Protecting information from misuse and unauthorized disclosure  
  - Helping businesses navigate challenges in asset classification  

> Building your expertise in asset management and classification will help you provide real value to organizations and protect what matters most.
